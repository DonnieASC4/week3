	Title: Hex to Decimal
	Create a function which converts a hexadecimal number (given as a string) to a decimal number.
	Hint: Documentation is your friend.
	Definition of Hexadecimal Number:
		A Hexadecimal or base 16 is a numeral system that uses 16 symbols
		(0 to 9, after 9 count from A to F).
		1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
		0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  A  B  C  D  E  F 
		A six-digit combination of these 16 numbers and letters is a hexadecimal. Most
		commonly we use it represent color in place of rgb(). 
		More Info: https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hexadecimal
		For Example:
		 color: #fff (being white --> equivalent --> rgb(255, 255, 255))
		
	Binary is base-2 meaning 0 or 1. Each hexadecimal has an equivalent sequence of 
	1s and 0s.
